# Conditions and Loops

## How to automate repition ?
[Code](./loops.js)

Loops are used to repeat execution of a task again and again based on condition. 

**process.stdout.write()** is feature of nodejs run-time. 
**alert()** is a feature() in browsers and not for terminal based run-times like nodejs.
```js
process.stdout.write();
```
We have for , while, do-while loops in JS.

**break** brings us out of the loop.
**continue** skips the further lines of code in loop when it hits.


## Conditionals

We have already been using it. 

## Switch-Case
[Code](../01_Introduction%20to%20JS/switch.js)

Pretty simple.
