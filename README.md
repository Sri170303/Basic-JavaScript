# Starting with JavaScript

## JS Introduction

Building a project requires a lot of planning.
Let's consider registration page of a website. It takes input from the user and saves these details for further processing.
These details include name, email, phone-number, age, gender, address, etc. 
If we look carefully, these details could be numbers, strings or collection of numbers/ strings/ both.
Languages have built-in data-types to store and process them.

Some built-in data types in JS are:
string, number, boolean, object, array.

strings, numbers and boolean are easy to understand.

objects are collection of key-value pairs.

arrays are collection of indexed values.


JavaScript gets a lot of functionalities from the environment in which it runs. 
Browsers have Javascript run-time environment that includes execution engine and rendering engine. V8 is the execution engine used by Chrome.
Nodejs is another run-time environment and it also used the V8 execution engine.

Consider printing on the console. We have console.log(), console.error(), console.warn() like methods in the browsers. When they are run, they display the message in different way.
