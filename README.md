# JavaScript

Building a project requires a lot of planning.
Let's consider registration page of a website. It takes input from the user and saves these details for further processing.
These details include name, email, phone-number, age, gender, address, etc. 
If we look carefully, these details could be numbers, strings or collection of numbers/ strings/ both.
Languages have built-in data-types to store and process them.

Some built-in data types in JS are:
string, number, boolean, object, array.

strings, numbers and boolean are easy to understand.

objects are collection of key-value pairs.

arrays are collection of indexed values.


JavaScript gets a lot of functionalities from the environment in which it runs. 
Browsers have Javascript run-time environment that includes execution engine and rendering engine. V8 is the execution engine used by Chrome.
